However, as more people became interested in these releases, it became increasingly difficult to secure a pair since they sold out within seconds. I soon realized that the process of purchasing was always the same: logging in, selecting a size, entering your address, choosing a payment method, and completing the checkout. By consistently refining my approach, I discovered that the key to success lay in automating these steps for greater efficiency. ",-1),h=e("p",{class:"mb-4"}," A few friends and I teamed up to develop an automated solution for the checkout process of limited items, especially sneakers. Our team of four shares a passion for learning new things and we saw the project as an opportunity to develop new skills while also making some extra money by reselling on the side.

Chrome extensions are small software programs designed to customize and enhance the browsing experience. They allow users to modify browser functionality and behavior in various ways. Running in a separate, sandboxed environment, these extensions enable you to "extend" the browser by using APIs to interact with web content. ',-1),u=e("p",{class:"mb-4"}," We soon realized that we were not the only ones developing a resell-focused extension. However, our success matched or even surpassed that of others. To manage distribution, we decided to release our script to a select group of users—our beta testers. To restrict access, we implemented a licensing model. Each beta tester was required to log into our dashboard using their Discord account, allowing us to collect user-specific data such as user ID, name, and email. We then generated a unique license key for each user and stored it along with their Discord user ID and email in our database. To use the extension, users must log in with their Discord account and enter their license key. We then generate a unique fingerprint for each user to ensure that the script can only be used on one device at a time. This data is sent to our backend, where it verifies whether the user is authorized to log in. If a user wants to switch devices, they must first reset the key, which removes the old fingerprint from the database, allowing the new one to be stored. ",-1),m=e("p",{class:"mb-4"}," As more testers joined, I realized we had a responsibility to our users. Even though the product was free at that time, they expected regular bug fixes and improvements. The beta phase lasted about six months, during which we consistently pushed updates and gained a deeper understanding of the community. By the end of this period, we had developed a very stable product. Encouraged by user feedback, we decided to take the next big step and make the script available to a larger audience for a monthly fee. However, we still had some details to finalize, such as handling payments and deciding whether to build the user dashboard ourselves or use a service provider. ",-1),p=e("p",{class:"mb-4"},[t(" Since our primary focus was still on learning, we decided to continue developing the existing dashboard and integrate the payment provider Stripe. The dashboard gives users an overview of their license key and subscription, and they can also view change logs after updates. We also implemented a rewards system to boost our presence on Twitter. When a user successfully buys a product using our script and posts an image of the item on Twitter, they earn points. These points can be redeemed for various rewards, such as stickers, a free month of service, or a €5 discount on the monthly fee. To automate different aspects of the process and save time, I programmed several Discord bots. One of these bots automatically posts images from Discord to Twitter, and you can find the code on "),e("a",{class:"text-primary",href:"https://github.com/fabioeletto/discord_twitter_image_uploader",target:"_blank"},"GitHub"),t(". ")],-1),f=e("p",{class:"mb-4"}," By the end of 2020, after a year of development and testing, we were ready to launch our script for a monthly fee. In the first few months, we had around 200 to 300 active users from across Europe. In March 2021, our customer base grew significantly thanks to an effective marketing strategy. We offered the script for free testing for a limited time, attracting over 2,000 users. After the trial period, we allowed them to purchase the full product, resulting in a steady user base of around 1,000 active monthly users. This success confirmed that all our efforts over the past year had paid off. For the rest of the year, we worked tirelessly to make further improvements, adding features like an auto-updater and a multi-user function that allows synchronization across multiple browser windows. Reflecting on the last two years, I've learned a great deal and am very grateful for the experience.
